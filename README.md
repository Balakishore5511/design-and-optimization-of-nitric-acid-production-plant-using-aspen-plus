## Design and Optimization of nitric acid production plant using Aspen plus

this project is about designing a  nitric acid production plant in aspen plus simulation software. 


## Source:
  the designing process is carried out by keeping a already existing design. the reference design is taken from book - ["Chemical Engineering Design: Principles, Practice and Economics of Plant and Process Design- 2nd edition" by Towler G, Sinnott R".](https://nitsri.ac.in/Department/Chemical%20Engineering/PED_ResourceBook1.pdf) pg no: 157 and 158.
